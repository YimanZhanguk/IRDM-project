# IRDM-project
This is the Information retrieval and data mining coursework in ucl(cs) web science and big data analytics.
Here we upload the code for our final model rf-nn-tf-idf and part our previous versions.
## description of project
Ranking is a key problem in many information retrieval problems, and this project focuses on predicting the product search relevance problem. We used Home depot Kaggle data to develop a learning to rank model aiming to predict the productâ€™s relevance for a given query. A combined model which we call it rf-nn-tf-idf model was implemented success- fully. It combines the algorithms of random forest, Back- propagation Neural Network Perceptron Regressor, and tf- idf (term frequency and inverse document frequency). This report shows the specific process of developing our model, selecting the most effective features and optimizing param- eters, and evaluating the results.
## description of our final model
### parameters
parameters of randomforest: n estimators = 730, random state = 2120. And for NN regressor are: hidden layer size = (10,3), alpha = 0.0001, random state = 2050, batch size = 171.
